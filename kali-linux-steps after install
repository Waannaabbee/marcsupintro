	$kali-linux (Metapackages)
Steps to Install a Metapackage
Update the System: While not mandatory, it is highly recommended to update the system to ensure the metapackages can be installed without any unexpected side effects. 
The procedure to update Kali is documented in detail on the page Updating Kali, but in short, it boils down to two commands:

kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt full-upgrade -y

This step might take a while, depending on how many packages need to be updated.
Install a Metapackage: After updating, installing a metapackage (e.g., kali-linux-default) is simply a matter of running one command:
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y kali-linux-default
Using Kali Tweaks: Alternatively, you can use kali-tweaks to install metapackage groups. Run the following command:
kali@kali:~$ kali-tweaks
Navigate to the “Metapackages” tab, select the desired metapackages, hit “Apply,” then “OK,” and finally supply your password.
